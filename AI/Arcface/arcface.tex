    \section{Motivation}
        Feature learning demands discrimination which is in some major way endowed by the 
        loss function design. Additive Angular Margin Loss (Arcface) is so proposed to 
        incorporate intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy, the two aspect for
        discrimination. This paper claims that arcface constantly outperforms SOTA on 
        large databases.
